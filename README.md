# Hi, I'm Darren 👋

## 🚀 About Me

**What I do:**
Large enterprises love AI, but often struggle to move beyond basic chatbots to tangible business ROI. I help organizations build and launch advanced **Agentic AI** solutions that drive measurable impact in scalable, unique ways.

**Key Works** 
Built "GENie", an Enterprise-grade AI Agent Builder for Meta and AWS: [**AWS x BCG x Meta partnership**](https://partner-resources.awscloud.com/aws-gamechangers/aws-bcg-meta-apj-telecom-solutions-partnership-3)


## ⚡ What I Build (The Philosophy)

This repository is my home for practical engineering. I build:
1.  **LifeOS Tools:** Apps that remove friction from my own life.
2.  **SME Solutions:** Lightweight tools that solve heavy operational problems for my clients.
3.  **Agentic Experiments:** Unique workflows pushing the boundaries of what AI agents can automate.


## 📂 Featured Projects

### 1. Chrome River Automator 
**Status:** MVP (Alpha v0.1) | **Stack:** JavaScript, Chrome API

**The Problem: The "Receipt Gap"**
Chrome River is a popular expense tracking platform for enterprises. Employees can automatically upload receipts, but must still **manually type in data** into the form (Location, Price, Currency, Meal Type), which takes up to **1 minute per receipt**, meaning users spend 1-2 hours every month just filing claims.

**The Solution:**
I built a browser extension that bridges this gap.
* **1-Click Action:** Instantly parses receipt data and injects it into the form fields.
* **Speed:** Reduces task time from **1 minute → 2 seconds**.
* **Impact:** Makes expense filing TRULY automatic, saving my office **200+ FTE days per year**.
